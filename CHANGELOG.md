# Changelog

All notable changes to avmatrix will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-05-08

#### Changed

- Made Web UI analyze entry points behave as full analyze actions: landing repo cards, local-path analyze, header re-analyze, and header analyze-new now run `/api/analyze` before graph loading.
- Made Web/API analyze force a rebuild at the backend worker boundary so clients cannot accidentally trigger the up-to-date shortcut for user-facing analyze actions.
- Changed post-analyze graph loading to route by selected physical `repoPath` and then by canonical `repoInfo.repoPath` from `/api/repo`, rather than by display name or basename.
- Kept header repository dropdown switching as a load/open-existing-graph action, separate from analyze, while still routing selected repos by path.

#### Fixed

- Fixed Web UI analyze/load drift where a completed analyze could reload a graph by `repoName` and show a different same-name repository.
- Fixed backend repo resolution so absolute paths are matched before name/basename lookup and remain path-first after registry refresh while analyze jobs complete.
- Fixed header re-analyze failure handling so start/SSE failures surface the selected repo path instead of failing silently on the prior graph.

#### Documented

- Documented the Web UI full-analyze path contract and repoPath-first graph loading behavior in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### 2026-05-07

#### Added

- Added the Accurate Single-Pass Graph path: parse workers now emit AST-reused `ParsedFile` scope facts, finalize scope/import indexes once, and feed `resolutionPhase` in the default analyze run.
- Added scope-aware graph emission for `CALLS`, `ACCESSES`, `USES`, `INHERITS`, finalized `IMPORTS`, and import-use edges with audit metadata.
- Added Python AST-reused scope capture coverage for imports, classes, functions/methods, `self` bindings, typed `self.field` properties, member calls/accesses, type references, and inheritance.
- Added per-language benchmark coverage reporting and explicit benchmark target git-state metadata, including `repoGitUnavailable` when a target repo is not a git checkout.

#### Changed

- Narrowed legacy `crossFilePhase` so it skips source reread/reprocess work when parse metrics prove complete AST-reused scope coverage.
- Moved useful cross-file receiver/type propagation into scope facts and `resolutionPhase` for TypeScript/JavaScript patterns such as call returns, awaited calls, aliases, field/method-derived receivers, destructuring, for-of elements, JSDoc params, chained fields, and callable properties.
- Made method dispatch strategy-aware through finalized scope inheritance facts and provider MRO strategy inputs.
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the new 13-phase pipeline, `resolutionPhase`, scope fact boundary, crossFile narrowing, resolution workers, and benchmark artifact protocol.

#### Fixed

- Made scope graph emission fail closed when graph node endpoints cannot be mapped.
- Merged scope audit metadata into existing semantic duplicate edges instead of emitting overlapping relationships.
- Fixed ambiguous same-file method/function graph-node aliasing so file-level functions are not hidden by same-name methods.
- Fixed Windows full-suite validation by using Vitest v4 `--no-isolate` for selected single-process forked tests and keeping native DB/API impact tests out of unstable hidden worker paths.

#### Performance

- Added auto/force/off reference-resolution worker mode with deterministic chunk parity checks and worker usage/count metrics.
- Removed avoidable worker-index byte-measurement overhead and added benchmark comparison coverage for resolution timing, graph parity, semantic duplicates, and per-language scope coverage.

### 2026-04-30

#### Changed

- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to match the current codebase: CLI/MCP/HTTP backend, Web UI, shared contracts, Windows local launcher, repo-scoped graph reads, and the Codex/Claude Code session bridge contract.
- Polished the Web UI header, repo dropdown placement, graph loading copy, runtime controls, chat panel spacing, and status/footer presentation.
- Simplified the AI runtime settings panel around the actual local session state instead of legacy provider/model configuration.
- Added global button press states and refined button borders while keeping the repo tree and repo dropdown visually lighter.

#### Fixed

- Unified external graph node selection so choosing a file from the dashboard or selecting a result from search follows the same graph selection/display path as clicking a node in the graph canvas.

### 2026-04-29

#### Added

- Added the repo-scoped HTTP read engine for repo switching and graph loading.
- Added shared repo resolution/runtime ID helpers, a repo-scoped read executor, a graph read/stream service, and a graph streaming HTTP adapter.
- Added focused unit coverage for repo resolution, repo read execution, graph streaming, MCP alignment, and repeated dropdown repo-switching.
- Added an OS-backed local folder picker for analyzing local repositories from the Web UI.
- Added repo removal actions on the repository landing screen.
- Added a placeholder `user_guide.md` entry and removed the placeholder logo from active UI surfaces.

#### Changed

- Migrated `/api/graph`, `/api/query`, `/api/search`, and `/api/grep` away from the old process-global LadybugDB retargeting path for repo-switch graph-load scope.
- Kept AVmatrix local-only: no cloud control plane, no managed workspace import model, and no required always-on daemon.
- Refreshed the repository list after analyzing a repository from the dropdown flow.
- Reworked loading UI copy and removed the fake hard-coded graph download percentage.

#### Fixed

- Fixed the Web UI dropdown repo-switch failure path by replacing the broken global DB switch/read path with explicit repo-scoped graph reads.
- Fixed dropdown analyze flow so newly analyzed repositories appear in the repository list.

#### Release Notes

- Marked the repo-switch graph engine plan complete for the graph-load scope.
- Bumped the CLI package version to mark the repo-switch engine completion point.

### 2026-04-25

#### Added

- Added the packaged root HTML launcher flow for Windows.
- Added `Start-AVmatrix.html`, `AVmatrixLauncher.exe`, the Go launcher source, packaged Web UI output, backend server wrapper, and protocol registration for `avmatrix://start`.
- Added launcher reset/start/stop behavior around the same local backend runtime.

#### Changed

- Moved launcher sources and build output from hidden `.avmatrix-launcher/` to visible `avmatrix-launcher/`.
- Updated launcher path references, protocol registration, and build packaging after the directory move.

#### Documented

- Added local launcher entry and root HTML launcher plans.
- Documented reset/analyze lifecycle risks around stale runtime processes, repo locks, WAL corruption, and clean rebuild boundaries.
- Paused the full analyze optimization plan after the delivered speedup and measured LadybugDB/FTS bottleneck.

### 2026-04-24

#### Performance

- Added full analyze phase timing and deep persistence instrumentation.
- Made the parse worker path canonical for full analyze and removed the old silent whole-repo sequential fallback behavior from the optimized production path.
- Implemented a deterministic dynamic parse worker scheduler.
- Reduced large-repo parse time on the benchmark path from the prior sequential-fallback profile to the worker-canonical profile while preserving output counts.
- Cached cross-file parser query work after measuring crossFile internals.

#### Fixed

- Fixed Go receiver source attribution during crossFile reprocessing so receiver method calls are not incorrectly attributed to same-name interface methods.
- Made community detection deterministic by fixing randomization/input ordering behavior.

#### Documented

- Recorded full analyze Phase 0 through Phase 4 findings.
- Closed Phase 2 without resolver/linker optimization after measurement showed parse main-thread resolve was not a material bottleneck.
- Paused deeper LadybugDB/FTS optimization until there is a safer strategy that preserves stored graph/search behavior exactly.
- Added the Web graph load/render performance plan as a separate concern from full analyze performance.
