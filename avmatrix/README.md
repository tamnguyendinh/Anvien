# AVmatrix

**Graph-powered code intelligence for AI agents.** Index any codebase into a knowledge graph, then query it via MCP or CLI.

Works with **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **OpenCode**, and any MCP-compatible tool.

## Why?

AI coding tools don't understand your codebase structure. They edit a function without knowing 47 other functions depend on it. AVmatrix fixes this by **precomputing every dependency, call chain, and relationship** into a queryable graph.

**Three commands to give your AI agent full codebase awareness.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Index your repo (run from repo root)
avmatrix analyze
```

That's it. This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` context files — all in one command.

To configure MCP for your editor, run `avmatrix setup` once — or set it up manually below.

`avmatrix setup` auto-detects your editors and writes the correct global MCP config. You only need to run it once.

### Editor Support

| Editor | MCP | Skills | Hooks (auto-augment) | Support |
|--------|-----|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | Yes | Yes | Yes (PreToolUse) | **Full** |
| **Cursor** | Yes | Yes | — | MCP + Skills |
| **Codex** | Yes | Yes | — | MCP + Skills |
| **Windsurf** | Yes | — | — | MCP |
| **OpenCode** | Yes | Yes | — | MCP + Skills |

> **Claude Code** gets the deepest integration: MCP tools + agent skills + PreToolUse hooks that automatically enrich grep/glob/bash calls with knowledge graph context.

### Community Integrations

| Agent | Install | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| [pi](https://pi.dev) | `pi install npm:avmatrix` | [AVmatrix integration](https://github.com/tamnguyendinh/AVmatrix) |

## MCP Setup (manual)

If you prefer to configure manually instead of using `avmatrix setup`:

### Claude Code (full support — MCP + skills + hooks)

```bash
# First install the local CLI onto PATH (for example: `cd avmatrix && npm link`)
claude mcp add avmatrix -- avmatrix mcp
```

### Codex (full support — MCP + skills)

```bash
# First install the local CLI onto PATH (for example: `cd avmatrix && npm link`)
codex mcp add avmatrix -- avmatrix mcp
```

### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global — works for all projects):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "avmatrix": {
      "command": "avmatrix",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenCode

Add to `~/.config/opencode/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "avmatrix": {
      "command": "avmatrix",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

AVmatrix builds a complete knowledge graph of your codebase through a multi-phase indexing pipeline:

1. **Structure** — Walks the file tree and maps folder/file relationships
2. **Parsing** — Extracts functions, classes, methods, and interfaces using Tree-sitter ASTs
3. **Resolution** — Resolves imports and function calls across files with language-aware logic
   - **Field & Property Type Resolution** — Tracks field types across classes and interfaces for deep chain resolution (e.g., `user.address.city.getName()`)
   - **Return-Type-Aware Variable Binding** — Infers variable types from function return types, enabling accurate call-result binding
4. **Clustering** — Groups related symbols into functional communities
5. **Processes** — Traces execution flows from entry points through call chains
6. **Search** — Builds hybrid search indexes for fast retrieval

The result is a **LadybugDB graph database** stored locally for your repo in `.avmatrix/`, with full-text search and semantic embeddings.

## MCP Tools

Your AI agent gets these tools automatically:

| Tool | What It Does | `repo` Param |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `list_repos` | Discover all indexed repositories | — |
| `query` | Process-grouped hybrid search (BM25 + semantic + RRF) | Optional |
| `context` | 360-degree symbol view — categorized refs, process participation | Optional |
| `impact` | Blast radius analysis with depth grouping and confidence | Optional |
| `detect_changes` | Git-diff impact — maps changed lines to affected processes | Optional |
| `rename` | Multi-file coordinated rename with graph + text search | Optional |
| `cypher` | Raw Cypher graph queries | Optional |

> With one indexed repo, the `repo` param is optional. With multiple, specify which: `query({query: "auth", repo: "my-app"})`.

## MCP Resources

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `avmatrix://repos` | List all indexed repositories (read first) |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/context` | Codebase stats, staleness check, and available tools |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/clusters` | All functional clusters with cohesion scores |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/cluster/{name}` | Cluster members and details |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/processes` | All execution flows |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/process/{name}` | Full process trace with steps |
| `avmatrix://repo/{name}/schema` | Graph schema for Cypher queries |

## MCP Prompts

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `detect_impact` | Pre-commit change analysis — scope, affected processes, risk level |
| `generate_map` | Architecture documentation from the knowledge graph with mermaid diagrams |

## CLI Commands

```bash
avmatrix setup                      # Configure MCP for your editors (one-time)
avmatrix analyze [path]             # Index a repository (or update stale index)
avmatrix analyze --force            # Force full re-index
avmatrix analyze --embeddings       # Enable embedding generation (slower, better search)
avmatrix analyze --skip-agents-md   # Preserve custom AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md AVmatrix section edits
avmatrix analyze --verbose          # Log skipped files when parsers are unavailable
avmatrix mcp                        # Start MCP server (stdio) — serves all indexed repos
avmatrix serve                      # Start local HTTP server (multi-repo) for web UI
avmatrix index                      # Register an existing local index folder into the global registry
avmatrix list                       # List all indexed repositories
avmatrix status                     # Show index status for current repo
avmatrix clean                      # Delete index for current repo
avmatrix clean --all --force        # Delete all indexes
avmatrix wiki [path]                # Generate LLM-powered docs from knowledge graph
avmatrix wiki --model <model>       # Wiki with custom LLM model (default: gpt-4o-mini)

# Repository groups (multi-repo / monorepo service tracking)
avmatrix group create <name>        # Create a repository group
avmatrix group add <name> <repo>    # Add a repo to a group
avmatrix group remove <name> <repo> # Remove a repo from a group
avmatrix group list [name]          # List groups, or show one group's config
avmatrix group sync <name>          # Extract contracts and match across repos/services
avmatrix group contracts <name>     # Inspect extracted contracts and cross-links
avmatrix group query <name> <q>     # Search execution flows across all repos in a group
avmatrix group status <name>        # Check staleness of repos in a group
```

## Remote Embeddings

Set these env vars to use a remote OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint instead of the local model:

```bash
export AVMATRIX_EMBEDDING_URL=http://your-server:8080/v1
export AVMATRIX_EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
export AVMATRIX_EMBEDDING_DIMS=1024          # optional, default 384
export AVMATRIX_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=your-key   # optional, default: "unused"
avmatrix analyze . --embeddings
```

Works with Infinity, vLLM, TEI, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, or OpenAI. When unset, local embeddings are used unchanged.

## Multi-Repo Support

AVmatrix supports indexing multiple repositories. Each `avmatrix analyze` registers the repo in the global registry at `~/.avmatrix/registry.json`.

## Supported Languages

TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, Ruby

**Imports** — cross-file import resolution · **Named Bindings** — `import { X as Y }` / re-export tracking · **Exports** — public/exported symbol detection · **Heritage** — class inheritance, interfaces, mixins · **Type Annotations** — explicit type extraction for receiver resolution · **Constructor Inference** — infer receiver type from constructor calls (`self`/`this` resolution included for all languages) · **Config** — language toolchain config parsing (tsconfig, go.mod, etc.) · **Frameworks** — AST-based framework pattern detection · **Entry Points** — entry point scoring heuristics

## Agent Skills

AVmatrix ships with skill files that teach AI agents how to use the tools effectively:

- **Exploring** — Navigate unfamiliar code using the knowledge graph
- **Debugging** — Trace bugs through call chains
- **Impact Analysis** — Analyze blast radius before changes
- **Refactoring** — Plan safe refactors using dependency mapping

Installed automatically by both `avmatrix analyze` (per-repo) and `avmatrix setup` (global).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- Git repository (uses git for commit tracking)

## Release candidates

Stable releases publish to the default `latest` dist-tag. When a pull request
with non-documentation changes merges into `main`, an automated workflow also
publishes a prerelease build under the `rc` dist-tag, so early adopters can
try in-flight fixes without waiting for the next stable cut. (Docs-only
merges are skipped.)

```bash
# Try the latest release candidate (pre-stable — may change at any time)
npm install -g avmatrix@rc
# — or —
npx avmatrix@rc analyze
```

Release-candidate versions follow the standard semver prerelease format
`X.Y.Z-rc.N`, where `X.Y.Z` is the next stable target (bumped from the
current `latest` by patch by default; `minor` or `major` when kicking off a
bigger cycle) and `N` increments per published rc. Example sequence:
`1.0.0-rc.1`, `1.0.0-rc.2`, …, then once `1.0.0` ships stable,
`1.0.1-rc.1`. See the [Releases page](https://github.com/tamnguyendinh/AVmatrix/releases)
for the full list; stable `latest` is unaffected.

## Troubleshooting

### `Cannot destructure property 'package' of 'node.target' as it is null`

This crash was caused by a dependency URL format that is incompatible with
certain npm/arborist versions ([npm/cli#8126](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/8126)).
It is fixed in the current AVmatrix codebase. Upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
npm install -g avmatrix@latest
avmatrix analyze
```

If you still hit npm install issues after upgrading, these generic workarounds
may help:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest            # update npm itself
npm cache clean --force              # clear a possibly corrupt cache
```

### Installation fails with native module errors

Some optional language grammars (Dart, Kotlin, Swift) require native compilation. If they fail, AVmatrix still works — those languages will be skipped.

If `npm install -g avmatrix` fails on native modules:

```bash
# Ensure build tools are available (Linux/macOS)
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install python3 make g++
# macOS: xcode-select --install

# Retry installation
npm install -g avmatrix
```

### Analysis runs out of memory

For very large repositories:

```bash
# Increase Node.js heap size
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=16384" avmatrix analyze

# Exclude large directories
echo "vendor/" >> .avmatrixignore
echo "dist/" >> .avmatrixignore
```

## Privacy

- All processing happens locally on your machine
- No code is sent to any server
- AVmatrix stores the local repo index in `.avmatrix/` inside your repo (gitignored)
- AVmatrix keeps the global registry in `~/.avmatrix/`

## Web UI

AVmatrix also has a browser-based UI for local development — your code never leaves the browser.

**Local Backend Mode:** Run `avmatrix serve` and open the web UI locally — it auto-detects the server and shows all your indexed repos, with full AI chat support. No need to re-upload or re-index. The agent's tools (Cypher queries, search, code navigation) route through the backend HTTP API automatically.
