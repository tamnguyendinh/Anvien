## Benchmark Rules

The benchmark file records measurements.

It should contain:

- metadata and companion files;
- benchmark rules;
- benchmark sections such as `B0`, `B1`, or sections by phase/task;
- metric tables with unit, baseline, latest, final, target, and delta when needed;
- inventory count;
- runtime or performance metric;
- graph, coverage, or accuracy metric;
- package, bundle, file size, or hash metric;
- before/after numbers;
- UI, layout, or browser metric when the plan involves UI;
- command-surface or generated-output inventory when the plan involves generated documentation.

Benchmark records measured numbers only. Do not put command logs, design decisions, or validation narrative here. Build/test/e2e pass-fail belongs in evidence unless the timing, count, or size is the measured target.

Benchmark sections follow plan phases:

- `B0` corresponds to `P0`.
- `B1` corresponds to `P1`.
- `B2` corresponds to `P2`.
- Use item-level IDs such as `B-P1-A` when a checklist item needs separate benchmark evidence.
- Create a benchmark section only when the matching phase has benchmarkable measurements.
- Do not invent fixed metric categories; record the measurements required by the matching plan phase.

For performance release gates, capture at least five comparable runs before v2 cutover and at least five final runs. Use median for analyze/DB-load and p95 for query latency. Baseline and final must use the same commit-bound corpus, configuration, build mode, machine, and warm/cold-cache policy.

## Non-Benchmarkable Notes

- P1-A contract ratification and P8 Supervisor/cleanup/closure are evidence gates, not benchmarkable product/runtime work.
- Build/test/e2e pass/fail belongs in the evidence ledger; only measured duration, count, size, throughput, latency, memory, parity, and accuracy ratios are recorded here.
- A final plan cannot close while any required P7 performance row remains pending. A budget exception must contain measured baseline/final values and explicit owner acceptance; it cannot be replaced by an unmeasured waiver.
