# Accurate Single-Pass Graph Plan

## Position

AVmatrix should not choose between speed and graph accuracy.

If AVmatrix is faster because it removed or reduced GitNexus-style scope resolution work, that is workload reduction, not a complete optimization. The target is an accurate graph in one analyze run, without a separate deep mode and without a second source/AST pass.

## Goal

One `analyze` run should perform:

```text
scan
parse
extract scope facts from the same AST
finalize imports/scopes
build heritage, MRO, and method-dispatch indexes
resolve references/calls/accesses/uses/inheritance
communities
processes
load DB
```

The graph should keep or exceed the accuracy of GitNexus scope resolution while avoiding duplicate reads, duplicate parses, and duplicate resolution work.

GitNexus is only the accuracy baseline, not the performance target. AVmatrix should use GitNexus deep graph behavior as the minimum correctness floor, then beat its wall time by changing the architecture.

Success means:

- accuracy is equal or better than GitNexus deep/scope graph on the measured edge categories;
- wall time is materially lower than GitNexus for the same repository and equivalent graph accuracy;
- target speedup is at least 2x on large repositories, with a minimum acceptable first milestone of 40% lower wall time if parity work exposes unavoidable correctness cost;
- query/context behavior after load remains fast because audit metadata and indexes are available in the default graph.

Every implementation slice must be measurable. A change is not considered an optimization unless an AVmatrix analyze benchmark artifact records the relevant before/after timings, counters, edge counts, unresolved counts, and correctness snapshot. If the slice changes resolution behavior, benchmark output must include resolution timings and edge parity counters.

Benchmarking in this plan means measuring AVmatrix before and after each implementation slice. Do not spend plan time running GitNexus locally unless the user explicitly asks for that run. GitNexus numbers can be supplied externally and are used as the accuracy/performance baseline, not as the benchmark command for each AVmatrix slice.

## Non-Goals

- Do not re-add GitNexus `scopeResolutionPhase` as a second full pass.
- Do not introduce `fast` first and `deep` later as the primary path.
- Do not pass native AST `Tree` objects between workers and the main thread.
- Do not rely on find-and-replace refactors for symbol movement.

## Problem

GitNexus has valuable scope resolution logic after cross-file analysis. That work improves graph accuracy by resolving imports, calls, accesses, inheritance, and uses with language-aware scope rules.

The cost comes from the execution model:

- files are filtered and processed by language;
- file contents can be read again;
- AST cache may only exist in the main process;
- worker-mode parsing can leave no reusable AST cache for scope resolution;
- scope resolution may parse again;
- cross-file and scope-resolution responsibilities overlap.

AVmatrix currently avoids much of that cost by not running the same scope-resolution phase in the main phase list. That makes the pipeline faster, but it can also reduce deep graph accuracy. The correct fix is to bring the accuracy back through a different architecture.

## Current AVmatrix Constraints

AVmatrix already contains the beginning of the correct architecture:

- parse workers can emit `ParsedFile[]`;
- shared scope-resolution types already define `ParsedFile`, `ReferenceSite`, `Reference`, `ReferenceIndex`, and `ResolutionEvidence`;
- `finalizeScopeModel(parsedFiles)` already materializes scope indexes;
- `emitReferencesToGraph(...)` already drains a `ReferenceIndex` into graph edges with confidence and evidence;
- available audit metadata (`resolutionSource`, `evidence`, `fileHash`) is now persisted through LadybugDB and surfaced in graph/context/impact read paths; remaining work is coverage, not storage plumbing.
- `finalizeScopeModel` now builds an initial `methodDispatch` index from finalized inheritance reference sites; full per-language Heritage/MRO inputs remain to be integrated before parity claims.
- providers can emit scope captures through an AST-aware hook; source-text capture remains a compatibility path and any provider relying on it is not on the optimized default path.
- the existing graph-level `mroPhase` currently depends on `crossFile`; it cannot serve as the pre-resolution method-dispatch dependency without being split or reordered.

Therefore this plan must not introduce a parallel `ScopeIR` schema unless the existing shared model is proven insufficient. The default approach is to reuse and extend the existing shared scope-resolution contracts.

## Target Architecture

### 1. Parse Once, Emit Existing Scope Facts

Parse workers should return serialized scope artifacts in addition to the existing legacy extracted facts.

```ts
type AccurateParseArtifact = ParsedFile;
```

`ParsedFile` already carries:

- lexical scopes;
- local definitions;
- parsed imports;
- pre-resolution `ReferenceSite[]`.

If extra fields are needed, add them to the shared scope-resolution model deliberately. Do not create local duplicate fact types that drift from `avmatrix-shared`.

The worker already has source text and AST context. It should extract all resolution facts before returning. The main process should not read the same file again for scope resolution.

Scope extraction must reuse the AST already produced in the parse worker. A provider path that reparses source text to emit scope captures is not acceptable for the optimized default path.

### 2. Pass Facts, Not AST

Do not attempt to move native tree-sitter AST objects across worker boundaries. Workers should return deterministic JSON facts, primarily `ParsedFile[]` and existing extracted arrays.

Benefits:

- no native object transfer issues;
- no worker/main AST cache mismatch;
- easier snapshot testing;
- stable incremental hashing;
- smaller and more explicit resolution inputs.

### 3. Wire The Existing Scope Model Into The Pipeline

The current worker path can collect `parsedFiles`, but the main parse phase must preserve them through `ParseOutput` and downstream phases.

The intended flow is:

```text
parse workers
  -> ParsedFile[]
  -> finalizeScopeModel(parsedFiles)
  -> SemanticModel.attachScopeIndexes(...)
  -> build pre-resolution heritage/MRO/method-dispatch indexes
  -> resolutionPhase builds ReferenceIndex
  -> emitReferencesToGraph(...)
```

This keeps the accurate graph path in the default analyze run and avoids source rereads.

The pre-resolution method-dispatch index is a lookup structure for resolving calls. It is separate from graph-level MRO edge emission. The current `mroPhase` may be split or replaced, but call resolution must not wait for a post-`crossFile` phase.

### 4. Replace CrossFile + ScopeResolution With ResolutionPhase

Introduce one `resolutionPhase` that owns cross-file symbol resolution and scope-aware edge emission.

Input:

- parsed symbols;
- `ParsedFile[]`;
- finalized scope indexes;
- route/tool/ORM facts if available;
- heritage/MRO facts needed for owner-scoped dispatch;
- language provider resolution hooks.

Work:

- build global symbol table;
- consume finalized import/export graph;
- build per-file lexical indexes;
- build inheritance and method-dispatch indexes before resolving calls;
- resolve references;
- resolve calls;
- resolve member accesses;
- resolve inheritance;
- emit import-use and finalized import graph edges where needed;
- emit graph edges once.

This phase should replace overlapping responsibilities currently split between `crossFilePhase` and a GitNexus-style `scopeResolutionPhase`.

Important: `crossFilePhase` currently performs useful type propagation by re-reading selected files and re-running call processing. Do not delete that behavior early. Move the useful propagation logic into `resolutionPhase`, then retire or narrow `crossFilePhase` only after parity is proven.

### 5. Parallelize Resolution

Resolution should not run sequentially by language.

Proposed model:

```text
Phase A: parse workers produce ParsedFile[]
Phase B: main builds immutable global indexes
Phase C: resolution workers resolve chunks of ParsedFile/reference sites against readonly indexes
Phase D: main merges edges and diagnostics
```

Chunking should follow the AVmatrix dynamic worker model: small work units, byte/file limits, retry support, and ordered merge after completion.

Readonly indexes should be initialized once per resolution worker, not serialized with every chunk. Track serialized index size and worker init time as explicit metrics.

### 6. Keep Accuracy Auditable

Edges should include source, confidence, and evidence metadata.

```json
{
  "type": "CALLS",
  "resolutionSource": "scope-resolution",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "evidence": [
    { "kind": "type-binding", "weight": 0.35, "note": "receiver User" },
    { "kind": "import", "weight": 0.25, "note": "imported from models/user.ts" }
  ],
  "fileHash": "..."
}
```

This preserves auditability without making accurate graph generation optional.

Because the in-memory graph and LadybugDB persistence are not currently equivalent for evidence metadata, this work must persist audit metadata through DB load.

In-memory-only evidence is not sufficient for the optimized accurate graph because query/context tools operate after graph load.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Move a TypeScript/JavaScript object-pattern destructuring propagation slice into AST-reused scope facts with `field-access`, for example `const { profile } = user; profile.save()`.
- [x] Move a TypeScript/JavaScript object-pattern call-result propagation slice into AST-reused scope facts with synthetic receivers, for example `const { profile } = await makeUser(); profile.save()` and `const { profile } = provider.getUser(); profile.save()`.
- [x] Move a TypeScript/JavaScript for-of variable element propagation slice into AST-reused scope facts, for example `const users = listUsers(); for (const user of users) user.save()`.
- [x] Move TypeScript/JavaScript JSDoc `@param` receiver type propagation into AST-reused scope facts, for example `/** @param {User} user */ function run(user) { user.save(); }`.
- [x] Move the TypeScript/JavaScript imported exported-variable receiver propagation path into `resolutionPhase`, for example `service.ts` exports `const user = getUser()` and `app.ts` imports `user; user.save()` without a second source read or AST parse.
- [x] Add a diagnostic `--skip-legacy-cross-file` benchmark mode that keeps the phase boundary and accumulator disposal but skips legacy source reread/reprocess work, so scope-only graph parity can be measured directly.
- [x] Resolve TypeScript/JavaScript chained field receivers through finalized field type facts, for example `result.graph.forEachNode()` where `result: PipelineResult` and `PipelineResult.graph: Graph`.
- [x] Resolve TypeScript/JavaScript calls to function-valued properties through the scope graph, for example `forEachNode: () => Graph` followed by `result.graph.forEachNode()`.
- [ ] Move useful `crossFilePhase` type propagation into `resolutionPhase`.
- [ ] Retire or narrow `crossFilePhase` only after parity is proven.
- [x] Add duplicate-edge checks so legacy and scope-aware paths do not emit overlapping edges.
- [x] Map scope-resolved references to real graph node ids and fail closed when either endpoint is missing.
- [x] Preserve owner-qualified TypeScript/JavaScript member declaration names so same-file same-name members resolve distinctly.
- [x] Merge scope audit metadata into existing semantic duplicate edges instead of discarding the scope-resolved evidence.
- [x] Add regression coverage for same-file same-name member mapping, duplicate audit metadata merge, and DB persistence/readback.
- [x] Keep native DB and CLI analyze E2E tests in a sequential Vitest project to reduce Windows full-suite instability.
- [x] Validate targeted parity fixtures and audit persistence tests cleanly.
- [x] Make aggregate full `cd avmatrix && npm test` pass without Vitest worker-fork unhandled errors on Windows.
- [x] Keep `local-backend.test.ts` in the single-process forked Vitest path so native DB full-suite validation stays clean on Windows.
- [x] Keep `api-impact-e2e.test.ts` in the single-process forked Vitest path so hidden `vmForks` worker exits do not invalidate full-suite validation on Windows.
- [x] Define full UI validation build as `avmatrix-launcher\build.ps1`, not CLI-only build.
- [x] Add TypeScript/JavaScript AST-reused interface property signatures and type-alias RHS type-reference facts.
- [x] Add a precomputed owner-member index for receiver method/field dispatch so expanded scope facts do not force O(total defs) member scans per lookup.
- [ ] Benchmark equivalent-accuracy runs and confirm the speed target is met.

- Target: `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main` using `--skip-git` because that local copy has no `.git` directory.
- Runtime command used built AVmatrix CLI with `--skip-agents-md --no-stats --benchmark-json` and `node --stack-size=4096`; the default stack failed in parse with `Maximum call stack size exceeded`, so the stack-size requirement is part of the recorded run context.
- Result: `110714.1ms` total wall time, `847` files, `19538` nodes, `31037` persisted relationships.
- Phase timings: parse `44866ms`, crossFile `19563ms`, resolution `4043ms`, lbugLoad `23891.3ms`, FTS `15676.9ms`.
- Edge counts: `CALLS=5550`, `IMPORTS=202`, `ACCESSES=184`, `USES=711`, `INHERITS=1`.
- Scope counters: `143226` reference sites, `10632` resolved, `132594` unresolved, `1348` emitted, `5180` duplicate edges merged/skipped, `2989` skipped no caller, `1115` skipped missing target.
- Parallel-resolution experiment: enabling worker resolution on this repo changed `resolution` from `4043ms` to `4838ms` and produced a small graph diff (`ACCESSES -1`). That is not an accepted optimization. The worker path is kept opt-in via `AVMATRIX_SCOPE_RESOLUTION_WORKERS=1` until index transfer/build overhead is reduced and graph parity is proven.
- Safe default after the experiment: `reports/benchmark/2026-05-06-avmatrix-safe-default-gitnexus-main.json` keeps worker resolution disabled by default and measured `resolution=3956ms`; graph counts still varied slightly from the first run, so benchmark claims must use repeated median runs and parity checks rather than a single artifact.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-06-avmatrix-ts-interface-typealias-gitnexus-main.json` records the AVmatrix slice that added TypeScript interface property and type-alias RHS scope facts. It increased resolved references but also increased wall time; it is a correctness expansion, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-06-avmatrix-owner-member-index-gitnexus-main.json` records the AVmatrix owner-member index optimization after that correctness expansion.
- AVmatrix benchmark comparison, `ts-interface-typealias-scope-coverage` -> `owner-member-index-scope-resolution`: wall `126700.1ms` -> `105688.7ms` (`-16.6%`), resolution `6905ms` -> `895ms` (`-87%`). This is an accepted optimization for the receiver-dispatch lookup path because it keeps the expanded scope facts and replaces repeated owner-member scans with a precomputed index.
- AVmatrix benchmark comparison, previous safe default -> `owner-member-index-scope-resolution`: wall `110029.8ms` -> `105688.7ms` (`-3.9%`), resolution `3956ms` -> `895ms` (`-77.4%`), `USES` `711` -> `816`, resolved references `10604` -> `14177`, unresolved references `131143` -> `129718`. Relationship counts still vary slightly (`ACCESSES +1` vs safe default), so do not claim final equivalent-accuracy success until repeated median runs and parity checks are done.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-06-avmatrix-call-return-gitnexus-main.json` records the first cross-file return-type migration slice: TypeScript/JavaScript emits AST-reused `call-return` type bindings for variables assigned from imported function calls, and scope lookup resolves the imported callable's `returnType` through finalized bindings. Unresolved `call-return` facts fail open to the previous lookup behavior so they do not suppress existing fallback resolution.
- AVmatrix benchmark comparison, `owner-member-index-scope-resolution` -> `call-return-type-binding-scope-resolution`: wall `105688.7ms` -> `107954.6ms` (`+2.1%`), resolution `895ms` -> `1041ms` (`+16.3%`), crossFile `19001ms` -> `18808ms` (`-1.0%`), `ACCESSES` `181` -> `185`, resolved references `14177` -> `14236`, unresolved references `129718` -> `129036`, scope reference sites `143895` -> `143272`, scope-emitted edges `1450` -> `1454`, and crossFile reprocessed files `188` -> `187`. This is a correctness/architecture migration slice, not a speedup claim; sample the new `ACCESSES` edges, explain the reference-site count movement, and use repeated median benchmark runs before treating it as equivalent-accuracy progress toward retiring `crossFilePhase`.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-06-avmatrix-awaited-call-return-gitnexus-main*.json` records the awaited-call-return migration slice: TypeScript/JavaScript now emits the same AST-reused `call-return` binding when a variable is assigned from `await makeUser()`. Three repeated AVmatrix runs on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main` measured wall times `108632.8ms`, `108070.6ms`, and `108712.7ms`; median wall time is `108632.8ms`. Resolution timings were `999ms`, `895ms`, and `901ms`; median resolution is `901ms`. Relationship counts varied across identical-code runs (`ACCESSES` `184`, `181`, `184`), proving this benchmark target still has small graph-count nondeterminism. Do not use this slice to claim final equivalent-accuracy success or speedup; use it as correctness coverage plus evidence that the benchmark protocol must compare repeated medians and graph parity, not one artifact.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-deterministic-member-access-gitnexus-main*.json` records the determinism fix after investigating the repeated-run graph drift. Root cause: TypeScript/JavaScript scope capture compared tree-sitter `SyntaxNode` wrappers by JS object identity while classifying member expressions; worker runs can materialize equivalent AST nodes as different wrapper objects, which produced nondeterministic extra `read` facts and `ACCESSES` edge drift. The fix compares nodes by stable `type/startIndex/endIndex` and keeps member-call callees from emitting duplicate read facts. A parse-only two-run check on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main` now has `diffFiles=0` and `scopeReferenceSites=127585` both times. Two full analyze benchmark artifacts now have `graphDiffs=0`, identical `nodeDigest`, identical `relationshipDigest`, `ACCESSES=179`, `CALLS=5550`, `IMPORTS=202`, `USES=816`, `INHERITS=1`, `scopeResolutionResolvedReferences=14049`, `scopeResolutionUnresolvedReferences=113536`, and `scopeResolutionEdgesEmitted=1448`. Wall times were `109379.8ms` and `108327ms`; resolution was `853ms` and `851ms`. This is accepted as a determinism/correctness fix, not a final equivalent-accuracy speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-for-of-call-return-element-gitnexus-main.json` records the first for-of iterable return-element migration slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits `call-return-element` type bindings from the reused AST for `for (... of callable())` loop variables and the registry resolves iterable return annotations such as `User[]`, `Array<User>`, `Iterable<User>`, `List<User>`, and `Set<User>` to the element owner before member dispatch. The targeted fixture proves imported `listUsers(): User[]` can resolve `user.save()` through scope facts without source rereads. On `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, graph counts and digest remained identical to the deterministic baseline (`graphDiffs=0`, `ACCESSES=179`, `CALLS=5550`, `USES=816`, `scopeResolutionResolvedReferences=14049`), meaning this repository did not exercise a persisted-edge-changing instance of the new pattern. Wall time was `108030.8ms` and resolution was `869ms`; treat this as correctness coverage and crossFile-migration groundwork, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-receiver-propagated-alias-gitnexus-main.json` records the receiver alias propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits `receiver-propagated` type bindings from the reused AST for identifier aliases such as `const current = user`, and registry lookup follows that alias with a cycle guard before method/field dispatch. The targeted fixture proves an alias of an imported `makeUser(): User` return can resolve `current.save()` without source rereads. Compared to the for-of slice on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, graph counts and digest stayed identical (`graphDiffs=0`, `ACCESSES=179`, `CALLS=5550`, `USES=816`), while scope resolution resolved `10` additional references (`14049` -> `14059`) and unresolved references dropped by `10`; emitted persisted edges stayed flat because those resolutions merged with existing semantic duplicates. Wall time was `108706ms`, crossFile was `19348ms`, and resolution was `1010ms`; this is correctness/crossFile-migration coverage, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-member-derived-type-bindings-gitnexus-main.json` records the field/method-derived propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits `field-access` and `method-return` type bindings from the reused AST, and registry lookup derives the next receiver owner through the receiver's field `declaredType` or method `returnType` with direct-owner-before-MRO walking. The targeted fixture proves imported `User.profile: Profile` and `User.getProfile(): Profile` can both resolve later `Profile.save()` calls without source rereads. Compared to the receiver-alias slice on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, scope resolution resolved `265` additional references (`14059` -> `14324`) and unresolved references dropped by `265`; persisted `ACCESSES` increased `179` -> `180`, emitted scope edges increased `1448` -> `1449`, and `graphDiffs=3` because relationship count/type/digest changed. Wall time was `110024.1ms`, crossFile was `19148ms`, and resolution was `1052ms`. Treat this as an accuracy-changing migration slice, not a final speedup claim; individual new-edge audit requires keeping both pre/post relationship lists, not only benchmark digests.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-object-pattern-field-access-gitnexus-main.json` records the object-pattern destructuring propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits AST-reused `field-access` type bindings for destructured receiver fields such as `const { profile } = user` and aliased pairs such as `const { displayName: name } = user`. The targeted fixture proves imported `User.profile: Profile` can resolve later `profile.save()` through finalized scope facts without source rereads. Compared to the member-derived slice on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, persisted graph counts and digest stayed identical (`graphDiffs=0`, `ACCESSES=180`, `CALLS=5550`, `USES=816`), while scope resolution resolved `6` additional references (`14324` -> `14330`), resolved accesses increased `4768` -> `4774`, and unresolved references dropped by `6`. Wall time was `107316.4ms`, crossFile was `18711ms`, and resolution was `1100ms`. Treat this as correctness/crossFile-migration coverage; the lower wall time is a single-run observation, not a final speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-object-pattern-call-result-gitnexus-main.json` records the object-pattern call-result propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits a synthetic receiver binding from the reused AST for destructuring call results, using `call-return` for imported/free calls and `method-return` for receiver method calls, then emits destructured fields as `field-access` bindings against that synthetic receiver. The targeted fixture proves `const { profile } = await makeUser()` and `const { profile } = provider.getUser()` can both resolve later `Profile.save()` calls without source rereads. Compared to the object-pattern field-access slice on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, persisted graph counts and digest stayed identical (`graphDiffs=0`, `ACCESSES=180`, `CALLS=5550`, `USES=816`), while scope resolution resolved `36` additional references (`14330` -> `14366`), resolved accesses increased `4774` -> `4810`, and unresolved references dropped by `36`. Wall time was `120518.7ms`, crossFile was `20527ms`, and resolution was `1190ms`; treat this as correctness/crossFile-migration coverage, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-for-of-variable-element-gitnexus-main.json` records the for-of variable element propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits `call-return-element` facts for loop variables iterating over a previously typed collection variable, and registry lookup can resolve the element owner through that collection's `call-return`, `call-return-element`, propagated, or iterable annotation binding. The targeted fixture proves `const users = listUsers(); for (const user of users) user.save()` resolves through scope facts without source rereads. Compared to the object-pattern call-result slice on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, persisted graph counts and digest stayed identical (`graphDiffs=0`, `ACCESSES=180`, `CALLS=5550`, `USES=816`), while scope resolution resolved `171` additional references (`14366` -> `14537`), resolved accesses increased `4810` -> `4980`, resolved calls increased `8299` -> `8300`, and unresolved references dropped by `171`. Wall time was `108150.9ms`, crossFile was `18852ms`, and resolution was `1234ms`; treat this as correctness/crossFile-migration coverage plus a useful single-run timing observation, not a final speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-resolution-workers-estimated-index-gitnexus-main.json` records the workerized reference-resolution overhead slice. Worker mode still has graph parity with serial default on `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main` (`graphDiffs=0`, identical edge counts, `resolvedReferences=14537`, `unresolvedReferences=113048`), but it remains slower than serial default: resolution `1234ms` serial vs `3435ms` worker. The change removes an avoidable `JSON.stringify` pass used only for byte metrics, dropping worker readonly index bytes from exact JSON `32975703` to the same estimator used by serial `16898514`, and reducing worker resolution from `3628ms` to `3435ms`. Keep worker mode opt-in; do not mark default parallel resolution complete until index transfer/build overhead is lower than serial.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-jsdoc-param-scope-gitnexus-main.json` records the JSDoc parameter propagation slice. TypeScript/JavaScript now emits AST-reused `parameter-annotation` bindings and synthetic type-reference sites from preceding `@param {Type} name` comments, so JavaScript-style receivers can resolve without source rereads. The targeted fixture proves `/** @param {User} user */ function run(user) { user.save(); }` resolves both the type-reference and receiver method call. On `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, graph counts, digest, and resolution counters stayed identical to the for-of variable slice (`graphDiffs=0`, `resolvedReferences=14537`, `unresolvedReferences=113048`), meaning this repository did not exercise persisted graph changes for this pattern. Wall time was `109619.9ms`, crossFile was `19086ms`, and resolution was `1212ms`; treat this as provider coverage, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-imported-exported-variable-scope-gitnexus-main.json` records the first direct migration of a `crossFilePhase` receiver-propagation responsibility into `resolutionPhase`. The registry context now has a finalized `def -> TypeRef` index, so an import binding such as `app.user -> service.user` can follow `service.user`'s AST-reused `call-return` type fact and resolve `user.save()` without re-reading `app.ts` or `service.ts`. The targeted fixture covers `models -> service -> app` in both serial and worker reference resolution. On `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, persisted graph counts stayed identical to the JSDoc slice (`graphDiffs=0`), while scope resolution improved by `+8` resolved references and `-8` unresolved references (`resolvedReferences=14545`, `unresolvedReferences=113040`). Wall time was `108956.6ms`, crossFile was `18990ms`, and resolution was `1169ms`; this is an accuracy slice, not a speedup claim yet because `crossFilePhase` still runs.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-scope-only-crossfile-skip-gitnexus-main.json` records the first diagnostic scope-only run with `--skip-legacy-cross-file`. It removed `18990ms` of crossFile work and improved wall time by `19.1%`, but raw graph parity failed (`graphDiffs=9`, `CALLS` `5550 -> 5112`, process/community counts changed). A pipeline-level audit with graph phases skipped showed `438` missing raw `CALLS`; `424` were duplicate-only semantic keys and `14` semantic call keys were absent. Therefore this flag is a measurement tool only, not a default path, until the remaining unique gaps are either resolved by scope facts or classified as legacy false positives with an explicit accuracy decision.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-chained-receiver-scope-gitnexus-main.json` records the chained receiver slice. Scope lookup can now resolve receiver owners through finalized field types for dotted receivers such as `result.graph.forEachNode()` without source rereads. The targeted fixture proves the `Graph.forEachNode` call and `PipelineResult.graph` read both resolve. On `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, persisted graph counts stayed identical to the imported exported-variable slice (`graphDiffs=0`), while scope resolution improved by `+41` resolved references and `-41` unresolved references (`resolvedReferences=14586`, `unresolvedReferences=112999`). Wall time was `112344.7ms`, crossFile was `19085ms`, and resolution was `1483ms`; treat the wall-time increase as single-run noise plus extra lookup work, not a speedup claim.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-chained-receiver-scope-only-crossfile-skip-gitnexus-main.json` repeats the diagnostic scope-only run after chained receiver support. It still fails raw parity (`graphDiffs=9`, `CALLS` `5550 -> 5112`) while saving `19085ms` of crossFile work and improving wall time by `17.0%`. This confirms that the next work is not to skip crossFile wholesale; it is to close or classify the remaining non-duplicate semantic gaps, then narrow the legacy phase only where parity is proven.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-callable-property-scope-gitnexus-main.json` records the callable-property slice. Scope `CALLS` resolution now falls back to function-valued `Property`/`Variable`/`Const` definitions only when their `declaredType` is callable, so TypeScript interface properties such as `forEachNode: () => Graph` can be call targets without source rereads. The targeted fixture proves `result.graph.forEachNode()` resolves to the callable property and keeps the chained `graph` read resolved. On `E:\Lap_trinh\GitNexus-main`, scope resolution improved by `+282` resolved calls and `-282` unresolved references (`resolvedReferences=14868`, `unresolvedReferences=112717`). The graph gained `+4 CALLS` and one process change, so this is an accuracy-increasing slice rather than a parity-only optimization. Wall time was `109156.7ms`, crossFile was `19111ms`, and resolution was `1978ms`.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-callable-property-scope-only-crossfile-skip-gitnexus-main.json` repeats the diagnostic scope-only run after callable-property support. It still fails raw parity (`graphDiffs=9`, `CALLS` `5554 -> 5116`) while saving `19110ms` of crossFile work and improving wall time by `18.9%`. Because scope-only counters are now identical between default and skip runs, the remaining default/skip delta is legacy graph emission, duplicate relationships, process derivation effects, or semantic gaps outside current scope facts.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-semantic-benchmark-metrics-gitnexus-main.json` records the benchmark schema slice that adds semantic unique/duplicate relationship counts. Compared with the callable-property artifact, persisted graph counts and resolution counters stayed identical (`graphDiffs=0`, `CALLS=5554`, `resolvedReferences=14868`, `unresolvedReferences=112717`), while the new key metrics show `CALLS` has `5553` semantic-unique edges and `0` semantic duplicates in the default run. Wall time was `110108.9ms`, crossFile was `19241ms`, and resolution was `1868ms`; this slice improves measurement quality, not graph behavior.
- `reports/benchmark/2026-05-07-avmatrix-semantic-benchmark-metrics-scope-only-crossfile-skip-gitnexus-main.json` repeats the diagnostic scope-only run with the new semantic counters. It saves `19241ms` of crossFile work and improves wall time by `19.2%` (`110108.9ms -> 88926.6ms`), but parity still fails (`graphDiffs=9`). The key result is stricter than the earlier ad hoc audit: `CALLS` drops from `5554` to `5116`, and semantic-unique `CALLS` drops from `5553` to `5115` with `0` duplicate `CALLS` in both runs. Therefore default `crossFilePhase` still cannot be skipped or retired wholesale; the missing call edges must be migrated into `resolutionPhase` or explicitly classified as legacy false positives before narrowing the legacy phase.

Full build for UI/manual validation through `Start-AVmatrix.html`:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File avmatrix-launcher\build.ps1
```

This script builds `avmatrix`, builds `avmatrix-web`, builds `avmatrix-launcher\AVmatrixLauncher.exe`, builds `avmatrix-launcher\server-bundle\avmatrix-server.exe`, copies `node.exe`, copies the web build to `avmatrix-launcher\web-dist\`, and registers the `avmatrix://` protocol. A CLI-only `cd avmatrix && npm run build` is not enough before asking the user to test through the root launcher HTML.

Latest validation after the semantic benchmark metrics slice:

- Full launcher build passed with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File avmatrix-launcher\build.ps1`.
- Targeted benchmark snapshot tests passed cleanly: `3/3`, including semantic duplicate relationship counting and same-name/different-location node separation.
- Full `cd avmatrix && npm test` passed for this slice. The accepted captured log contained no `Unhandled Errors`, `Unhandled Error`, `Worker vmForks emitted error`, `Worker exited unexpectedly`, `Test Files .*failed`, `Tests .*failed`, or `FAIL` patterns.

### Milestone 1: Baseline And Parity Targets

- Add a machine-readable AVmatrix benchmark artifact, for example `avmatrix analyze --force --benchmark-json <file> --benchmark-label <label>`.
- The artifact must include graph correctness snapshot, edge counts by type, semantic unique/duplicate relationship counts by type, unresolved counts, phase timings, parse/crossFile/resolution/lbug timings, duplicate-read/parse proxy counters, and resolution chunk/index counters.
- Do not accept a speedup claim from console wall time alone.
- Run AVmatrix analyze metrics on representative repos.
- Run GitNexus deep/scope graph baseline on the same repos where possible. Treat it as the minimum accuracy baseline, not as an acceptable speed target.
- Record edge counts by type:
  - `CALLS`
  - `IMPORTS`
  - `ACCESSES`
  - `USES`
  - `INHERITS`
- Record unresolved reference counts.
- Sample-check precision for resolved calls/accesses/inheritance.
- Record precision and recall against fixture expectations where available.
- Treat edge counts as a secondary signal, not a success condition by themselves.

### Milestone 2: Align Existing Scope Contracts

- Reuse `ParsedFile`, `ReferenceSite`, `Reference`, `ReferenceIndex`, and `ResolutionEvidence`.
- Avoid introducing `ScopeIR` unless an explicit gap is documented.
- If the shared model needs more fields, add them to `avmatrix-shared` as the single source of truth.
- Keep the schema language-neutral.
- Put language-specific extraction behind provider hooks such as `emitScopeCaptures`, `interpretImport`, `classifyCallForm`, and `arityCompatibility`.
- Extend or replace `emitScopeCaptures` with an AST-aware worker path, for example `emitScopeCapturesFromTree(...)`, so providers do not reparse source text.
- Treat source-text-only capture emission as a compatibility path, not the optimized default.
- Make the AST-aware hook a hard implementation gate before TypeScript or any other provider is migrated to the optimized path.
- Add JSON snapshot tests for small fixtures.

### Milestone 3: Thread ParsedFile Through The Pipeline

- Make `runChunkedParseAndResolve` preserve `chunkWorkerData.parsedFiles`.
- Add `parsedFiles` to `ParseOutput`.
- Ensure `parsing-processor` output is not dropped at the phase boundary.
- Add metrics for parsed file count, scope count, local def count, import fact count, and reference site count.
- Add a metric that proves scope extraction reused the worker AST and did not trigger a second parse.

### Milestone 4: Complete Scope Extraction Coverage

- Migrate providers to implement `emitScopeCaptures` and related hooks.
- Start with one end-to-end language before broad migration. TypeScript is the preferred first target because it exercises imports, classes, methods, fields, calls, and arity without optional native parser risk.
- Add TypeScript fixture parity before enabling another language.
- Follow with Python, then JVM, Go, Rust, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift/Kotlin where parser availability allows.
- Extract facts while source text and AST are already available.
- Avoid any main-thread source reread for these facts.
- Add per-language coverage counters:
  - parseable files;
  - files with `ParsedFile`;
  - scopes emitted;
  - definitions emitted;
  - reference sites emitted;
  - unresolved reference rate.
- Define language coverage gates. AVmatrix can claim optimized accurate graph only for languages whose scope extraction and resolution coverage meet the parity threshold; mixed-language repo claims must report covered vs legacy language shares.

### Milestone 5: Finalize Scope Indexes

- Build the import-target workspace from existing language import resolvers.
- Call `finalizeScopeModel(parsedFiles, hooks)`.
- Attach scope indexes to the semantic model once per analyze run.
- Validate linked vs unresolved import counts.
- Preserve SCC information for resolution scheduling.
- Replace the temporary empty `methodDispatch` construction with an index built from heritage/MRO inputs before call resolution depends on it.
- Split pre-resolution method-dispatch index construction from the current graph-level `mroPhase`, or replace `mroPhase` with phases whose dependencies match this plan.
- Treat finalized imports as the import-resolution source of truth. Downstream resolution may emit import-use or graph `IMPORTS` edges, but must not resolve the same import targets again.

### Milestone 6: Implement Parallel ResolutionPhase

- Create `resolutionPhase`.
- Build a `ReferenceIndex` from finalized scope indexes and reference sites.
- Implement `resolveReferenceSites(...)`:
  - map `ReferenceSite.kind` to class, method, field, or generic definition registries;
  - use `callForm`, `explicitReceiver`, receiver/type bindings, and arity when resolving calls;
  - use method dispatch/MRO indexes for owner-scoped method calls;
  - select the top candidate by confidence and tie-break rules;
  - emit unresolved diagnostics when no candidate is safe enough.
- Resolve file/chunk reference-site units in workers.
- Keep chunk boundaries deterministic and expose chunk/index cardinality metrics before moving execution out to workers.
- Initialize readonly resolution indexes once per worker.
- Emit import, call, access, use, and inheritance edges in one place.
- Merge results deterministically.
- Add timing metrics:
  - index build ms;
  - worker index init ms;
  - resolution worker ms;
  - merge ms;
  - serialized index bytes;
  - emitted edge counts;
  - unresolved counts.

### Milestone 7: Persist Audit Metadata

- Decide the durable relationship metadata shape for evidence/resolutionSource/fileHash.
- Extend `GraphRelationship` if `resolutionSource` and `fileHash` become first-class relationship properties instead of encoded `reason` text.
- Extend LadybugDB relationship schema.
- Extend relationship CSV generation columns.
- Extend relationship CSV split/load paths.
- Extend fallback relationship insert parsing.
- Extend query/context readers so audit metadata is visible through tools after DB load.
- Keep `fileHash` as a nullable persisted field for legacy edges; scope-resolved edges should populate it from parse-time `ParsedFile.fileHash`.
- Preserve backward compatibility for existing relationship queries.
- Add tests that prove evidence metadata survives graph load.

### Milestone 8: Retire Overlap

- Move useful type propagation from `crossFilePhase` into `resolutionPhase`.
- Remove or narrow `crossFilePhase` responsibilities only after `resolutionPhase` reaches parity.
- Do not keep duplicate edge emission paths.
- Add duplicate-edge checks with source/confidence metadata.
- Remove hard caps that trade accuracy for speed, or make them explicit safety limits with diagnostics.
- Do not claim the target architecture is achieved while the default accurate pipeline still runs both `crossFilePhase` re-resolution and `resolutionPhase` for the same call/access/inheritance responsibilities.

### Milestone 9: Validate Performance And Accuracy

Validation commands:

```bash
cd avmatrix && npm test
cd avmatrix && npx tsc --noEmit
```

Benchmark protocol:

- run AVmatrix before/after on the same machine, same repository checkout, same exclude rules, and same parser availability;
- use externally supplied GitNexus deep/scope numbers as the baseline where the plan needs GitNexus comparison; do not re-measure GitNexus locally unless explicitly requested;
- record tool versions and commit hashes;
- record cold-cache and warm-cache runs separately;
- run at least three iterations and compare median wall time;
- include a small, medium, and large repository set, with "large" defined before measurement by file count and parseable MB;
- compare only equivalent accuracy configurations;
- publish language coverage for every benchmarked repo.

Benchmark dimensions:

- total wall time;
- parse ms;
- scope fact extraction ms;
- resolution ms;
- lbug load ms;
- graph stream ms;
- memory peak;
- worker utilization;
- unresolved references;
- semantic unique/duplicate relationships by type;
- edge precision/recall against fixtures;
- accuracy delta against GitNexus baseline;
- speedup over GitNexus at equivalent or better accuracy;
- second-parse count for scope extraction;
- evidence persistence coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- One default analyze run produces accurate scope-aware graph edges.
- No second source read for scope resolution.
- No second AST parse for scope resolution.
- `ParsedFile[]` is preserved from worker output through parse output.
- `finalizeScopeModel` is called in the default accurate pipeline.
- `ReferenceIndex` is populated and emitted to graph edges.
- `crossFilePhase` and scope resolution responsibilities are unified or clearly non-overlapping.
- Resolution is parallelized for large repos.
- The default accurate pipeline does not run duplicate cross-file re-resolution and new scope resolution for the same edge responsibilities.
- Edge precision/recall meets fixture expectations.
- Accuracy is equal or better than GitNexus baseline without relying only on higher edge counts.
- Wall time is at least 2x faster than GitNexus on large repositories at equivalent or better graph accuracy, or at least 40% lower for the first parity milestone with follow-up work explicitly identified.
- Analyze metrics expose parse, fact extraction, resolution, and DB load costs separately.
- Scope extraction reuses the worker AST and does not parse source a second time.
- Audit metadata is queryable after DB load.
- Benchmark results follow the documented protocol and report language coverage.

## Risks

- Scope contracts may grow too broad if language-specific details leak into shared code.
- Serialized facts may become large on generated or minified files.
- Parallel resolution needs deterministic merge behavior to avoid unstable graph diffs.
- Confidence metadata must not become a substitute for fixing low-quality resolution.
- Persisting evidence metadata may increase relationship storage size.
- Partial provider migration can create mixed legacy/new graph behavior unless metrics make coverage obvious.
- Retiring `crossFilePhase` too early can lose useful type propagation.
- Reusing the current post-`crossFile` `mroPhase` as a pre-resolution dependency would create an invalid phase dependency cycle or leave method dispatch incomplete.
- Benchmarks without equivalent accuracy settings can produce misleading speedup claims.
